obscure hard to track down, expensive
one advantage of modern keyboard

universial active protocol converter for retro computers




------------- scrap below -------------

USB4VC features a modular design, with protocol cards for different computer platforms.



* Many proprietary peripherals are simply hard to find, commanding a premium on online marketplaces, often on par with the computer themselves, and they are only getting rarer and rarer. Without them, the computer itself is useless.

* After 3 or 4 decades of service, many can degrade and be unreliable (e.g. foam & foil keyboards), requiring extensive restoration.

* Let's be honest here, most of the early input peripherals simply does not feel that great. Mushy membrane keyboards, sticky ball mice, plasticky gamepads, etc. And of course, high quality ones [gets very expensive](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=ibm+model+f&_sacat=0&rt=nc&LH_Sold=1&LH_Complete=1).
